Integrations allow you to enrich your chat experience. This may include all
kinds of things: Connecting to and from third party platforms to make your
conversations more productive… or more silly – like bridges, but not for chat.
Automate tasks with chat bots! Enrich your client's UI for specific use cases
with widgets! Build your own chat experience.
